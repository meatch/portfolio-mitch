I  helped to develop and maintain their Loyalty applications which serve Banks and Credit Unions, letting their customers use their points to book a Flight, Hotel, Car, Cruises, and Travel Packages. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\n    CTM has given me the opportunity to work in large teams (Agile) with many developers, quality assurance (QA), Scrum Masters, Product Managers, Business Analysts, Dev Managers, etc. Working on this team has expanded my ability to not only work with others, but to share code. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n    When developing solo projects you can do what you want, and, perhaps cut some corners just to meet a deadline.

    Formerly Montrose Travel, Corporate Travel Management (CTM) handles all sorts of travel needs. I  helped to develop and maintain their Loyalty applications which serve Banks and Credit Unions, letting their customers use their points to book a Flight, Hotel, Car, Cruises, and Travel Packages. 
</p>

<p>

    CTM has given me the opportunity to work in large teams (Agile) with many developers, quality assurance (QA), Scrum Masters, Product Managers, Business Analysts, Dev Managers, etc. Working on this team has expanded my ability to not only work with others, but to share code. 
</p>

<p>
    When developing solo projects you can do what you want, and, perhaps cut some corners just to meet a deadline.  When working in a team with Code Reviews, QA, and UAT, you learn a lot about building more scalable, maintainable code. 
</p>

<p>
    While at CTM I also:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Assisted in Dockerizing containers for our local developers</li>
    <li>
        Lead the effort for interviewing and onboarding 30 plus developers (working with recruiters, scheduling, screening, developing and grading exams, conducting interviews, and onboarding)
    </li>
    <li>Started an in-house NPM Package library to share features across our 2 primary apps, reducing duplication of work.</li>
    <li>Helped document many of opur processes, and widgets. The example Decision Tree demonstrates working with Business/Product to define clearly handling price change logic for flights. This diagram was used by Developers, QA, and Business to ensure we were all on the same page as to expected logic. I then implemented the price change logic along with testing solutions so we could all simulate a price change and test the results. </li>
    <li>Normalized all of our Buttons to take advantage of single source of logic (adhering to ADA 2.1 requirements). This also includes a focus effort to ensure all buttons were clearing, visibly accessible in all views.</li>
